# Spellbook-AI
The code used in the Spellbook AI project.  Functionally, I don't own the content in the corpus and thus you very should should not use this commercially without the consent of Pelgrane Press.  However, this app in and of itself is open source!

This is a fun little project that I've created to showcase the power of natural language processing AI applications.  I love 13th Age, and I love AI/ML, and I figured I'd combine these two things together to allow people who might be new to AI to see what it could potentially do!
